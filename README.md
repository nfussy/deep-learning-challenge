The report on the Neural Network can be found in this README.md file. The initial training code for the Neural Network model can be found in the 'Starter_Code.ipynb' file with a printout of the network available in the h5 file, 'AlphabetSoupCharity.h5'.

The additional attempts at optimizing the Nerual Network to achieve an accuracy score of 75% can be found in the 'AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.ipynb' file with a printout of the network in the h5 file, 'AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5'.
